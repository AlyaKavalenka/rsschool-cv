## About me

Working in the IT is my dream. I have been interested in programming since school, but it was decided to enroll in the Faculty of Economics. After university, I went to work for an insurance company. During those 2 years I gained a lot of experience, for example: working in stressful situations, communicating with clients, working in a team, searching and analyzing a large amount of data, and much more. But I realized that it wasn't mine.  
I decided to start my journey with front-end development.

I am constantly striving for self-study. I'm quick-learning, ambitious and highly motivated person. I approach the tasks assigned to me responsibly and with enthusiasm. I like to look for new ways to solve the same problem.
